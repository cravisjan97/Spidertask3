This app consists of two textviews.The first textview consists of a timer running.
On opening the application, the timer must be set for 10 seconds and after that it should extract the data 
from  http://spider.nitt.edu/~vishnu/time.php and update it in the other textview.
The timer must be again set for the last digit of the received number.
This process should continue as long as the user clicks the exit button.
